## A collection of data analysis done on kanji networks

This project has for goal to perform network analysis on the kanji characters used in Japanese and their relations. The goal is to get insight into linguistics using network science and hopefully learn a thing or two about an efficient way of learning kanji.

## The data and libraries used

The data used is JMdict, KanjiDic2, and most importantly KRADFILE/RADKFILE kanji-radical-kanji maps accessed with https://github.com/neocl/jamdict.

The network analysis uses networkx, and the rest of the analysis uses numpy, matplotlib, pandas.
